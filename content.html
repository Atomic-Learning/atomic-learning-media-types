There are many types of media that can be supported in the Atomic Learning Platform. This page outlines some common ones and some considerations for each.

<h2>Text</h2>

Most of the content on the Atomic Learning Platform is text-based. This is a deliberate choice as it ensures accessibility, ease of use across devices. It is also quick for learners to process, progress through, and refer back to as needed. Additionally, it is easy for authors to create and incrementally update text-based content. This is particularly important as the Atomic Learning platform is a long-term, collaborative effort. Variations of text including bullet points, numbered lists, tables, code snippets and equations are also supported.

<h2>Images</h2>

Images are commonly used to supplement text-based content. They can be used to illustrate concepts or provide visual examples, helping to engage learners and enhance understanding.

<h2>Videos</h2>

Videos should be used sparingly in the Atomic Learning Platform. While they can be effective for demonstrating processes or providing visual explanations, they can also present challenges. Videos are often slower to consume than text, can be less accessible, and may not work well across all devices or internet connections. In addition, videos are often difficult and time-consuming to incrementally update, making improving content over time, or fixing mistakes, more challenging. Sometimes a video will be the best choice, but this will be exceptional. The Atomic Learning platform is not designed to contain videos of lecture-like material.

<h2>GIFs</h2>

GIFs can be a useful alternative to videos. They can demonstrate processes or animations in a more lightweight format. The small self-contained nature of GIFs tends to make them easier to create and update. However, they should still be used judiciously, as they can also present accessibility and device compatibility challenges.

<h2>Embedded Interactive Elements</h2>

The Atomic Learning platform supports the embedding of interactive elements and these can be very effective for engaging learners and providing hands-on learning experiences. However, interactive elements can also introduce complexity and potential accessibility issues. It is important to ensure that any interactive content is well-designed, easy to use, and accessible to all learners.

<h2>Coding</h2>

Some peices of content will have an assocaited GitHub Codespace that users can open to edit and run code. This is particularly useful for examples and exercises.
